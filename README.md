# Movie-Rec-App

# User Story:
 As a user I want the ReelRecs app to offer me new movie suggestions based on genre and allow me to search for a movie, read the plot and be able to view a trailer for that movie.

 # Description:
 Website that displays the most popular movies for the top genres with ratings and allows you to search for any movie with a result of the movie description and a linked movie trailer 

# Future Development:
-   Link an API that allows you to search for the nearest theatre showing movies near you 
-   Allow user to search for movies based on a word or an actor 
-   Have the app make suggestions based on previous searches for personalized recommendations 
-   Have the app analyze movies based on data, ratings, and reviews
